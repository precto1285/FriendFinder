# FriendFinder

Deployed application: https://calm-shelf-68636.herokuapp.com/

This exercise in web development practices the building, deployment, and data saving aspects of a full stack application. The app itself is deployed to heroku where user inputted data will be saved to an internal js file (friends.js). 

The user is prompted to enter minimal information about themselves and answer some behavioral questions on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). A compatible friend is then determined based off of these user submitted "scores". A compatible friend is selected by finding a previously saved user who had little difference between answering all 10 behavior questions. Bootstrap modal js is then used to display the name of the best matched friend along with an image of the matched friend (assumming that the photo link they provided is working).
